Upon receiving your partnerâ€™s encrypted message for you, we can now decrypt it.

## Upload partner's public key
You should now locate the encrypted file that your partner sent you. In the tree view on the left hand side, right-click on the folder `lab-part1` and then press **Upload**.

Upload the file now. Once the upload is complete, press the **Close** button. Click on the folder to see the file and open the file to verify it looks like an encrypted file.

## Decrypt it
You are now ready to decrypt the message. Bring back the terminal window (you will see its tab in the top of the main panel to the left.)

You can now decrypt your message with the following command

```
decrypt private_key_file_name encrypted_file_name decrypted_file_name
```

Be sure to specify the file names correctly

Once you are done, open up the encrypted output file and copy and paste the contents into the box below.
