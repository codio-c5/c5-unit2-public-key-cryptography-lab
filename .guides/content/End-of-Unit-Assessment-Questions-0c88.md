1: What is the main difference between symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography?
*Answer: In symmetric cryptography the key used for encryption is essentially the same key used for decryption. In public key cryptography, the key used for encrypting a message does not work for decrypting it.*

2.What does asymmetric key cryptography provide that symmetric key cryptography does not? Explain.
*Answer: Asymmetric key cryptography solves the problem of key distribution in symmetric key cryptography. It also helps with key management, as each party only needs to have only a private and a public key, whereas in symmetric cryptography he/she needs as many keys as the number of people he/she is communicating with.*
