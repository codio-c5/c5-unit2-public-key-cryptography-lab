# Solution
**To decrypt the message all we needed from our partner was their encrypted file. This could be sent via any channel because none of this information is secret. The only secret is the private key which does not need to be shared.  Students will probably email each other the ciphertexts. Whether it is a secure email service or not will not matter.**
