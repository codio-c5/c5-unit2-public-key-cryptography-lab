Upon receiving your partners public key via email, you can send encrypted messages to him/her over a public channel (the Internet).

On the left we have opened up a file `message.txt`. Write your full name and a message for your partner in this file. 

## Upload partner's public key
You should now locate the public key that your partner sent you. In the tree view on the left hand side, right-click on the folder `lab-part2` and then press **Upload**.

Upload the file now. Once the upload is complete, press the **Close** button. Click on the folder to see the file and open the file to verify it looks like a public key.

## Encrypt
You are now ready to encrypt your message. In the terminal window on the left, encrypt your message with the following command

```
encrypt public_key_file_name message.txt encrypted_file_name
```

Be sure to specify your partners public key file name correctly and a valid output file name.

Once you are done, open up the encrypted output file and copy and paste the contents into the box below.
