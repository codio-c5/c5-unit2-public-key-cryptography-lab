Follow these steps:

- Status > Sender

- Algorithm Parameters > Choose defaults (Hit OK)
- Key > Set Key > Generate Key > Save key 
- Name the key file as yournameKey.private (for example, my file would be yesemKey.private.) and save it under KryptosAssignment folder. 
- Check your working folder to see that two new files are created: yournameKey.private and yournameKey.public. 
- Take a screenshot of the files in the folder to include in your submission.

Note that there are various options for each of the tasks. In practice, two parties would negotiate which option to use for each task.
Send the **public key** file to your partner via email.
