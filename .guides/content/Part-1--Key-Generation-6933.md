On the left is a Linux terminal window. We will first of all enter a command to create a private/public key pair.

## Generate key pair
To generate a private/public key pair, enter the following command, subsituting `<private>` and `<public>` with the actual filenames you want to create.

```
keygen <private> <public>
```

Once you have done this, click on the folder name `lab-part1` in the file tree on the left open up the private key file. 

Copy and paste the contents **into the box below**. Do the same for the public key, pasting it below the private key.

## Send the public key
You should now download the **public key file** and send it to your partner via email. To download, right click on the public key file name in the tree on the left and select "Download".
